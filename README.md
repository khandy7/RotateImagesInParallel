# Rotate PPM Images using MPI

 - This code was used for my final project in CSCI551 (Parallel and Numerical Programming Methods). 

 - The code will rotate PPM images orthogonally and time the completion time of rotating 52 images for comparison between the sequential and parallel implementations. 

 - Parallel method used is MPI.
